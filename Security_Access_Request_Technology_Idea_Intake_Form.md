## 1. Idea Intake Objective and Process

### Objective

To document information regarding a technology idea that will enhance business processes. Ideas will be presented to the Steering Committee for approval and prioritization. Anyone can submit an idea for consideration.

### Process

**Submitter's Role:** Complete and submit this form to Idea Intake Coordinator (Coordinator), Laurie Hansen. The form will be reviewed to ensure that the information is clear and concise. You may be asked to provide additional information or clarification. Once the form is complete, the Coordinator, submitter, and MNIT will meet to complete a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate. The form will be updated to include ROM and then forwarded to the steering committee to review and discuss during their monthly meeting.

The Coordinator will contact you and confirm the date for you and your supervisor/manager to attend the steering committee meeting to present the idea.

**Idea Intake Coordinator's Role:** The Coordinator is the primary point of contact for all idea intake activities. The Coordinator will work with the submitter, MNIT, and Steering Committee to ensure that the idea is facilitated through the process.

**Steering Committee's Role:** Review the idea and approve, conditionally approve, place on-hold/postpone, or reject the idea.

**Approved** – Ideas receiving approval will either be forwarded on for development of a business case paper or forwarded to a specific application support team for implementation as part of standard support work. Routing decisions will be made based on the understanding of the idea's initial scope, complexity, need for cross functional team engagement, funding, timeline, and availability of resources.

**Conditionally approved** – Ideas receiving conditional approval require additional actions to be completed (more research, providing clarity, etc.) before receiving full approval to move forward. Once the actions are complete, the idea form is resubmitted to the Coordinator for guidance on the next steps.

**On hold/postponed** – Ideas placed on-hold/postponed will be retained and revisited periodically for future consideration.

**Rejected** – Ideas that are rejected will be documented and stored but will not be given consideration.

## 2. Idea

### Security Access Request Web Application

We propose the development of a comprehensive Security Access Request Web Application to modernize and streamline the process of managing employee access to secure systems across Minnesota state agencies. This application will:

- **Streamline Access Request Process:** Provide an intuitive web-based interface for employees to request access to various secure systems (ELM, EPM/DWH, HR/Payroll, Accounting/Procurement) with clear role definitions and approval workflows.

- **Enhance Approval Workflows:** Implement automated routing to appropriate approvers (supervisors, agency security administrators, MNIT security teams) based on role type and security requirements, reducing manual handoffs and approval delays.

- **Improve Audit Compliance:** Create comprehensive tracking and reporting capabilities to support year-end audit reports prepared by Agency Security Administrators, including complete audit trails of all access requests, approvals, and role assignments.

- **Centralize Security Administration:** Provide Agency Security Administrators with a unified dashboard to review, approve, and manage access requests across their agencies, replacing manual forms and email-based processes.

- **Support Digital Signatures:** Implement secure digital signature capabilities to eliminate paper-based approval processes while maintaining required authorization documentation.

- **Enable Real-time Status Tracking:** Allow end-users, supervisors, and administrators to track request status in real-time, reducing follow-up inquiries and improving transparency.

- **Generate Automated Documentation:** Automatically generate required forms and documentation for MNIT security teams, ensuring consistency and completeness of access request packages.

This solution addresses the current challenges of manual, paper-based security access request processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to audit. The application will serve as the single source of truth for all security access requests across state agencies.

## 3. Business Drivers

(What are the driving factors for the business problem you are trying to solve? Please add a short statement of why you think the driver applies to your idea. Check all that apply.)

### Enterprise Drivers

☒ **Address an audit finding or regulatory requirements**

**Please explain:** Year-end audit reports prepared by Agency Security Administrators require comprehensive documentation of all security access requests, approvals, and role assignments. The current manual process makes it difficult to maintain complete audit trails and ensure compliance with state security policies. This application will provide automated tracking and reporting capabilities to support audit compliance and demonstrate proper security controls.

☒ **Support or improve business service delivery**

**Please explain:** The current manual, paper-based security access request process creates significant delays in onboarding new employees and granting necessary system access. IT Security Teams and Agency Security Administrators spend substantial time manually processing requests, routing forms, and tracking approvals. End-users experience frustration with unclear processes and lack of visibility into request status. This application will dramatically improve service delivery by automating workflows, reducing processing time from weeks to days, providing real-time status updates, and creating a user-friendly experience for all stakeholders.

☒ **Secure information assets**

**Please explain:** By implementing standardized role definitions, approval workflows, and comprehensive audit trails, this application will strengthen security controls around system access management. The application will ensure that access requests are properly reviewed and approved by appropriate authorities before granting access to sensitive systems, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or inappropriate privilege escalation.

## 4. Impact, if Not Approved

Without approval, state agencies will continue to rely on manual, paper-based security access request processes with the following negative impacts:

- **Audit Compliance Risks:** Agency Security Administrators will continue to struggle with preparing comprehensive year-end audit reports due to incomplete or scattered documentation of access requests and approvals. This increases the risk of audit findings and demonstrates weak security controls.

- **Operational Inefficiencies:** IT Security Teams and Agency Security Administrators will continue to spend excessive time manually processing paper forms, routing approvals via email, and tracking request status in spreadsheets or filing systems.

- **Poor User Experience:** End-users will continue to experience frustration with unclear processes, lost or delayed forms, lack of visibility into request status, and extended wait times (often weeks) to receive necessary system access.

- **Onboarding Delays:** New employee onboarding will be delayed due to slow access provisioning, impacting productivity and employee satisfaction during critical first weeks of employment.

- **Data Integrity Issues:** Manual data entry and paper-based processes will continue to result in errors, inconsistencies, and incomplete information in access request documentation.

- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Without standardized workflows and automated controls, there is increased risk of inappropriate access being granted, security requirements being overlooked, or access requests bypassing proper approval channels.

- **Lost Documentation:** Paper forms and email-based approvals are at risk of being lost or becoming inaccessible over time, creating gaps in audit trails and historical records.

The continued reliance on manual processes represents a significant operational burden, compliance risk, and missed opportunity to improve service delivery to state employees and agencies.
